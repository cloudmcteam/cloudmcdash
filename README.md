certbot certonly -d client.example.com

nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/cloudmcdash.conf

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <domain>;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
location /afkwspath {

  proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  proxy_pass "http://localhost:<port>/afkwspath";
